## Overview
Try to remember some of your first passwords. Most likely, they were passwords that were built around something memorable in your life, like your school, family, pet names, hobbies, and more. Ah, how naive and unassuming you were. Unfortunately, your very own passwords that you thought you grew and nurtured so well might as well be heaps of gold, piles of treasures for any reasonably skilled hacker around the globe. At a first glance, you may not imagine that a password above 8 characters could be easily cracked. After all, you can't even figure out a reasonable combination in the wardrobe. However, millions of users are phished for their personal data every year, lying defenseless as hackers prey down upon their data and finances.

Now you might wonder, what do these chronically online hackers do with their day? How long do they struggle in your emails, texts, and calls just to glean a morsel of information? Why don't they touch grass? Well, we'll say that these are completely valid questions. Sometimes, you just have to see the other side - what it's truly like to phish for information and what tactics phishers employ in their daily activities. Only when you view the world in a different lens do you truly learn what's behind the Phish-Eye.


## Our Idea 0_0

By playing the role of the sneaky phisher, you explore a victim's device and examine their personal data, finding key information that could lead you to cracking their RBC Bank password. Using generative AI and some very clever prompt engineering, we designed intricate, logical puzzles with key information that slowly leads you towards breaking bad. Keep your magnifying glasses peeled folks, dive deep into the world of phishing and develop a new perspective.
